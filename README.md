# Retail Performance Analysis with SQL and Power BI

## Overview
This project is a data analytics case study built using the "Sample - Superstore" dataset from Kaggle. The analysis was performed using SQL within DB Browser for SQLite and the results were conveyed using PowerBI. The primary objective was to uncover key business insights related to customer behavior, product performance, regional sales trends, and shipping efficiency. A series of SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions, including identifying high-value customers, analyzing the impact of discounts, evaluating profit margins across product sub-categories, and detecting unprofitable products. Additional queries examined regional and state-level performance, highlighting areas with high customer concentration or consistently low profitability. Shipping modes were also analyzed to determine which methods contribute to or detract from overall profit, with a focus on expedited shipping mechanisms such as "Same Day" and "First Class" shipments. Furthermore, time-based trends were explored through monthly sales analysis to understand seasonal patterns. Lastly, each SQL output was integrated into Power BI to build a set of interactive dashboards to visually display the findings.

The Sales Analysis dashboard component provides a comprehensive overview of sales data trends over time and across the United States. Foremost, cards are included to highlight the overall profit and sales generated by the Superstore from 2014 to 2017. Moreover, a table displays the top 10 individual products that generated the highest sales during this alotted time frame in descending order. Furthermore, a column chart conveys the profit margin percent by each product category, ultimately illuminating the market performance levels of each category. Lastly, a line chart displays the amount of total sales during the time frame of 2014 to 2017. In this line chart, tooltips are included so that users can view the total sales at a given day by hovering over the line. Additionally, a trendline is included to reveal the direction of sales performance across this alotted time frame, which is generally increasing. Lastly, a forecasting element is included to project the sales performance in 2018 at a 99% confidence level. The forecast line is denoted by the solid white line while the confidence lines are represented by the solid gold lines. Moreover, the gray shaded area between the two confidence lines denotes the possible sales performance levels in 2018 at a 99% confidence level.
