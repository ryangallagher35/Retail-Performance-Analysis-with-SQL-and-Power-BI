# Retail Performance Analysis with SQL and Power BI

## Overview
This project is a data analytics case study built using the "Sample - Superstore" dataset from Kaggle. The analysis was performed using SQL within DB Browser for SQLite and the results were conveyed using PowerBI. The primary objective was to uncover key business insights related to customer behavior, product performance, regional sales trends, and shipping efficiency. A series of SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions, including identifying high-value customers, analyzing the impact of discounts, evaluating profit margins across product sub-categories, and detecting unprofitable products. Additional queries examined regional and state-level performance, highlighting areas with high customer concentration or consistently low profitability. Shipping modes were also analyzed to determine which methods contribute to or detract from overall profit, with a focus on expedited shipping mechanisms such as "Same Day" and "First Class" shipments. Furthermore, time-based trends were explored through monthly sales analysis to understand seasonal patterns. Lastly, each SQL output was integrated into Power BI to build a set of interactive dashboards to visually display the findings.

## Sales Analysis

The Sales Analysis dashboard component provides a comprehensive overview of sales data trends over time and across the United States. Foremost, cards are included to highlight the overall profit and sales generated by the superstore from 2014 to 2017. Moreover, a table displays the top 10 individual products that generated the highest sales during this alotted time frame in descending order. Furthermore, a column chart conveys the profit margin percent by each product category, ultimately illuminating the market performance levels of each category. Moreover, a line chart displays the amount of total sales during the time frame of 2014 to 2017. In this line chart, tooltips are included so that users can view the total sales at a given day by hovering over the line. Additionally, a trendline is included to reveal the direction of sales performance across this alotted time frame, which is generally increasing. Lastly, a forecasting element is included to project the sales performance in 2018 at a 99% confidence level. The forecast line is denoted by the solid white line while the confidence lines are represented by the solid gold lines. Moreover, the gray shaded area between the two confidence lines denotes the possible sales performance levels in 2018 at a 99% confidence level. Lastly, a region slicer is included so that users may break down performance by region. Similarly, an interactive map feature is included in this dashboard component so that the user may break down performance by state by clicking on the blue dot in the state of interest.

## Customer Segmentation

In the Customer Segmentation dashboard component, multiple visuals are included to reveal customer-specific insights. Foremost, three tables are included to reveal (in descending order): (1) The total orders and expenditures for each customer of the superstore, (2) the top 20 least profitable customers by profit margin percentage, and (3) "High Value Customers," who are those who spent more that $10,000 at the superstore from 2014 to 2017. Furthermore, a scatter chart is included to display customer spending behaviors when discounts are applied, with the average line denoting the average spending behavior on discounted items. Lastly, a treemap displays customer concentration by region and state. In this treemap, a tooltip is included to highlight the specific customer concentration in each state. The sizes of each square nicely quantify the proportions of customer concentrations by region and state in relation to one another. 

## Shipping Performance

The Shipping Performance dashboard illuminates the performances of various ship modes and insights regarding negative profit instances. Foremost, two tables are included to display: (1) Total sales, total profit, and profit margin percent for each ship mode and (2) instances of expedited shipping that resulted in negative profit. The rationale behind including table (2) is to identify instances where the company should abstain from using expedited shipping, if possible, to avoid generating negative profit. Furthermore, a donut chart displays the frequencies of each ship mode during the time frame of 2014 to 2017, ultiamtely conveying that the majority of superstore customers prefer standard shipping when making online purchases. Lastly, a line chart displays the cumulative monetary effect of negative profit instances from 2014 to 2019. A trendline is included to generalize the behavior of the total monetary effect of total negative profit from 2014 to 2017, which illuminates that the magnitude of the monetary effect of negative profit instances generated by the superstore is increasing. Furthermore, a forecasting component is included to project the negative profit behavior in 2018 at a 99% confidence level. The solid white line denotes the forecast line while the solid gold lines denote the confidence lines. Additionally, the shaded gray area between the confidence lines denotes the possible monetary effect of negative profit instances in 2018 at a 99% confidence level. Lastly, the play axis feature below the line chart allows the user to view a simulation regarding how the monetary effect of negative profit instances changes from 2014 to 2017 (and projects into 2018).
